JAVA SCRIPT NOTES

There are 3 types of variables. var, let and const.
var is function scoped. once it is declared in function, it can be used any where in the function even inside other blocks( {} ) like if, for.
let is block scoped

REACT NOTES

ES6 (ECMA script)
classes
arrow functions
variables
array methods
destructing - it is easier way to assign values to the variables.
spread operator - it allows us to quickly copy values from one array to another array
modules - it allows us to breakup the code into separate files
